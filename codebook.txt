Dataset summary_data:
 - combines training and testing data originated from "Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine" by Davide Anguita et al. [1]
 - has 4 variables SubjectID, Activity, Measurement and Average
 
 - SubjectID originates from subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt provided with source data and it shows subject identifiers who were included in the study
 
 - Activity values originate from activity_labels.txt which are merged to y_test.txt and y_train.txt files by activity number and it shows different activities that subjects were involved during the study, e.g. walking, lying, etc.
 
 - Measurement values originate from features.txt provided with source data and it shows different measurements done in this study. According to authors: "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."

  - Average has an average value of each measurement for each activity and each subject. Unit of measurement is Hz.
